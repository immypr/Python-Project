# Corona-Tracker

Branch for the development of our Corona-Price-Tracker

Hi All,

Welcome to the Corona-Tracker of the Pythopaths. Here we present our Python project for the HSOG Intro to Python Class. It splits into three parts: I. Project Description, II. Project Realisation, III. Way Ahead.

##I. Project Description

End of last year (2019), a novel corona virus - the so-called COVID-19 - broke out in Wuhan, China. Since then, the virus has been constantly spreading and cases have been confirmed in over 90 countries to date (updated 3/6/2020 ). Given its unexpected emergence and rapid expansion, media outlets, health organizations as well as government authorities are providing nearly real-time information online to keep the global public informed. 
  Germany is no exception in this respect. Several public and private institutions are collecting, preparing and digitally publishing information on different aspects of the Coronavirus for the Germany based population. More specifically, to provide some examples: The Robert Koch Institut, the government’s central scientific institution in the field of biomedicine, is keeping track of confirmed cases within Germany ; the Federal Centre for Health Education is providing answers to frequently asked questions with respect to COVID-19 ; the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs compiles information for travellers ; and the media outlet Handelsblatt gives a regular update on the economic impact of the coronavirus – they even created a specific newsletter for this. 
  However, while some websites (e.g. of the Federal Ministry of Health ) do refer to the different sources at hand (including the abovementioned), there is no platform yet that bundles the different kinds of information in one place. The aim of our project is to fill this gap.  In a nutshell, we plan to create a platform that provides three services:
  First, it will display constantly-updated, general information about coronavirus-related developments in Germany. This could include i. confirmed coronavirus cases across German Federal States, ii. the effects of the coronavirus on the German financial market, as well as iii. supermarket product price fluctuations and availability.
  Second, the platform will be able to generate on-request, personalized information. Based on a user’s input, he or she may receive information, among others, on most recent official behaviour protocols, official contact points and/or risk levels for the area of residence or interest. 
  Third, the platform may integrate an alert function. Users may be able to select certain parameters and in case these exceed predetermined limits, he or she is informed.

##II. Project Realisation 
*Data Selection* – Evidently, the information provided by our platform will and cannot be exhaustive. It rather presents a selection of focal points e.g. ‘number of confirmed cases’ or ‘price fluctuations’ in Germany. The selection of these focal points is a work in progress and will not only depend on data access and availability, but will be largely guided by moral and societal principles. Above all, our project shall contribute negative to society, for example by stirring up panic. 

*Data collection* – 
- Explaining how we intend to collect the data -> using webscraping a.o. 

*Data processing* – 
- Explain how we wish to visualize the information -> what does the output look like?
- E.g. interface, maps, graphs…
- mention, that this work in progress ->  depends on/will be finalized/may be adapted to the data we get and also decide to focus on
